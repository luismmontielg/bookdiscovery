# Example django app

* Imported some books from google books API
* The users of the service could browse and discover books, by searching, and looking at recommended books
* A User can add books to "lists" (read/want to read)
* Once a user has read at least 2 books on a category, he is able to submit reviews
* A user get points for adding books to his lists, submitting reviews, and also if another user recommends the same books he has recommended (this is not implemented)

This is just show how to create a (dummy) application with django.
